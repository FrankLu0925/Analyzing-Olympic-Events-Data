# Olympic Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes Olympic events data to explore the fairness of the games, differences in physical fitness requirements across sports, and the predictability of medal-winning athletes based on their physical fitness.

## Objectives
- Assess the fairness of Olympic Games.
- Understand the varying physical fitness requirements across different sports.
- Develop a predictive model for identifying potential medal winners.

## Methodology
Statistical analysis and machine learning techniques are employed to analyze data, focusing on attributes like gender, height, weight, and country.

## Data Description and Feature Engineering
The dataset includes details on athletes' performances in various Olympic events. It involves addressing missing values and engineering features for analysis.

## Model Selection and Rationale
Decision tree models are chosen for their effectiveness in handling categorical data and interpretability, particularly for predicting medal winners in sports like basketball.

## Results and Conclusion
Key findings include gender equity in winning probabilities, the influence of an athlete's country on winning chances, and varied physical requirements across sports. The project concludes that while there are disparities, the overall fairness of the Olympic Games is maintained.
